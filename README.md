# Theres two fields in testphrases, one field that will take phrase and the input on the right that will take a phrase or a character. The second field will test against the first field to see if it matches. For example, if first field is test and second field is e, it will say it matches because it has the same character in the first field. Then press test and it will either say It is a match or it is not a match.
